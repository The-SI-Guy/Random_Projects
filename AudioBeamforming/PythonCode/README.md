# AudioBeamforming

## scripts descriptions

A few scripts going towards beamforming an Audio Array whether that ends up being microphones or speakers

- AudioArray.py simulates Array factor plots to visualize what the steering looks like
- Filters.py calculates FIR coefficients necessary for time delay beamforming
- SamplingFIRConvolution.py goes through the convolution by hand to see the response of the FIR filters
